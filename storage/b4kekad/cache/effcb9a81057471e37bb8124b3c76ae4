Enabling it only requires you to add the stackdriver exporter in the opencensus module. You can also configure Grafana to use Prometheus as the data source. This data is visualized above in the Grafana dashboard. While you can build your own dashboards, Istio offers a set of preconfigured dashboards for all of the most important metrics for the mesh and for the control plane. You've deployed an application that exposes a metric, verified that the metric is exposed, and verified that Prometheus scrapes the metric. If you’re a Panoply user, though, things are quite a bit easier. Finally, other query types for the Stackdriver data source are working fine in dashboard variables, only the "Label Values" option is affected.
