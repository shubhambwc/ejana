Leave-one-out cross-validation is a special case of cross-validation where the number of folds equals the number of instances in the data set.Thus, the learning algorithm is applied once for each instance, using all other instances as a training set and using the selected instance as a single-item test set.This process is closely related to the statistical method of jack-knife estimation . Three bootstrap methods are considered. A key insight is that one can approximate the properties of estimators by using . 1997. Each method resampling methods is called the bootstrap. Efron, B.

The Jackknife Estimate of Bias; The Jackknife Estimate of Variance; Bias of the Jackknife Variance Estimate; The Bootstrap; The Infinitesimal Jackknife; The Delta Method and the Influence Function; Cross-Validation, Jackknife and Bootstrap; Balanced Repeated Replications (Half-Sampling); Random Subsampling; Nonparametric Confidence Intervals. bootstrap which resamples from the data, mimicking the original sampling process Alternatives include Parametric bootstrap, which mixes resampling ideas with Monte Carlo simulation Computational tricks to get more efﬁcient calculations (balanced resampling) Subsampling, varying the size of the sample drawn from the data 31 In statistics, the jackknife is a resampling technique that is especially useful for bias and variance estimation.
