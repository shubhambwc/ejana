Official vs. Unofficial Transcripts Unofficial transcripts can be generated by a user on a school website, or they are printed and given to students for immediate use until an official transcript is generated. We recommend students check their unofficial transcript in MyIvy prior to paying the $5 fee just to be sure all of their final grades have been posted. Students, Faculty and Staff of Ivy Tech Community College receive a significant discount – validation sticker must be purchased from Ivy Tech. Send your official or unofficial transcript to admissions@goshen.edu. If you are awaiting final grades or a degree posted for the term, please verify on Campus Connect that your grades and/or degree have been posted to your unofficial transcript there BEFORE requesting an official transcript. Ivy Tech Students can either order an official transcript through their MyIvy account or through the National Student Clearinghouse.
