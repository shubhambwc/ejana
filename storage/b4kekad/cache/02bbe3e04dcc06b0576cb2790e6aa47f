This tutorial was built using the breakout boards from Sparkfun.The adafruit accelerometer breakout board also works, though it must be wired . The accelerometer can measure the static acceleration of gravity in tilt-sensing applications as well as dynamic . Testing ADXL345 accelerometer Arduino Interfacing. ADXL335 - Accelerometer. Interfacing ADXL335 With ARDUINO: As the datasheet says, ADXL335 is a small, thin, low power, complete 3-axis accelero-meter with signal conditioned voltage outputs. Description:This is a low cost ADXL335 IC module triple axis accelerometer. Code language: Arduino (arduino) The output values from the sensor actually depend on the selected sensitivity, which can vary from +- 2g to +-16g. Codebender includes a Arduino web editor so you can code, store and manage your Arduino sketches on the cloud, and even compile and flash them. VCC of Module to 5V pin of Arduino UNO. Arduino library to control Grove - 3-Axis Analog Accelerometer ADXL335. Acceleration is a process in which velocity is changed with respect to time and it is a vector quantity.
