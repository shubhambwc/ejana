The double-volume hypothesis by Gregory Bateson has proven to be a good explanation for the reasons for schizophrenia. Assessments of the cybernetic era often stress that the key members of the cybernetic movement were engaged in military research during World War II, and it was in that context that the relevance of feedback and servomechanisms became paramount.

Since its inception, cybernetics was more or less identified as a science of self-regulating and equilibrating systems, but the deviation-amplifying systems have not been given as much investment of time and energy by the mathematical scientists, and understanding and practical application on the part of geneticists, ecologists, politicians and psychotherapists.

Cybernetics, a term coined by the mathematician Norbert Wiener, is the study of the self-corrective feedback mechanisms in complex systems including both mechanical and social systems. But the growing interest in holism, systems, and cybernetics has also lead to a natural push for educators and students to publish his work. Gregory Bateson applied this idea to the theory of evolution and thus opened a highly productive perspective on the processes of adaptation. Bateson took the cybernetic explanation as far as it could go, eventually tackling the nature of the sacred in his aptly titled book “Angels Fear: Toward an Epistemology of the Sacred”. Researchers have also been looking for proof of symbol-handling by social birds and insects. His central project was the application of systems theory or cybernetics (defined by Norbert Weiner in 1948 as “the scientific study of control and communication in the animal and the machine”) to the fields of anthropology, psychology, history and ecology. Bateson used the single term cybernetics in reference to an aggregate of these ideas tha t grew together shortly after World War II, and for him, cybernetics, or communication theory, or information theory, or systems theory, together constituted a unified set of ideas.

Bateson next presents an essay on symmetry and metamery in animals, which is a cybernetic and information-theoretical reexamination of some very old and classical (and as yet unresolved) problems in embryology and morpho-genesis.

Post–World War Two, Bateson moves to the study of cybernetics and communication and shows that material dimensions of mass, length, time and their derivatives, of which thermodynamic energy is one, cannot be translated into similar dimensions when deriving an explanation of communication.

Gregory Bateson (1904-1980) was an anthropologist amongst many other things. From Versailles to Cybernetics According to Bateson, consciousness is the bridge between the cybernetic networks of individual, society and ecology and the mismatch between the systems due to improper understanding will result in the degradation of the entire supreme cybernetic system or Mind. And, interestingly, Bateson’s cybernetics also fed back into Watt’s expositions of Buddhism. patterns,” writes Bateson in “Cybernetic explanation” (1972). Social Explanation Inability to adjust to an insane society (Szasz) Absent or conflicting affect in family -- "double bind" (Bateson) Separation of self observed by others (role) from "inner self" (Laing) Approach: "Dialogic" therapies Bateson (1972) related this characterization to the theory of evolution. [1] Geoffrey Bateson, "Cybernetic Explanation" and "Redundancy and Coding" pp. Despite the great value of Wiener's Cybernetics in focusing attention on the many new robotic developments of the World War II period, it tended to obscure many of the critical points made in the earlier (1943) paper with regard to the role of negative feedback in scientific explanation. Larry Richards notes that Bateson used the term “restraint” referring to the approach of Cybernetics as “negative explanation”, focusing on what is not desirable, rather than what is. GB: Cybernetic Explanation Other readings: Norbert Wiener, The Human Use of Human Beings NB: Quo Vadis (for Tobbe – poem) NB: Me Watching You Watching Me Watching You He had a natural ability to recognize order and pattern in the universe. In the thirties, Bateson was seeking to understand the process of scientificthought through an explanatory process “within which the principles of explanation could be seen and studied.”2 By the forties, he began contributing to cybernetics, the newly-emerging fieldof communication and control of information. Rather it is descriptive language to describe human interaction, and possibly to free Bateson and his followers from the GREGORY BATESON ANGELS FEAR PDF.

Second-order cybernetics, or the cybernetics of cybernetics, the control of control, and the communication of communication (von Foerster 1996), by contrast, acknowledges that all explanations reside in language, the language of a community – cyberneticians, for example. Conscious Purpose versus Nature. For a basic definition, cybernetics can be defined as a multidisciplinary approach to study evolutionary processes and feedback-driven systems of … The ontology of archaeological information, or the cybernetics of archaeology, refers to all the interconnective relationships which the datum produces, the code of transmission, and its transmittability. From Versaille to cybernetics -- Pathologies of epistemology -- The roots of ecological crisis -- Ecology and flexibility in urban civilization. The importance of structured or formal modeling to cybernetics is well illustrated in Gregory Bateson's Steps to an Ecology of Mind (2000 edition, pp. Second order cybernetics sees the observer as part of the observed. Ernst von Glasersfeld (1996) Cybernetics and the Art of Living 2 enterprises is the fact that it operates with constraints rather than with efficient According to Bertrando (2000:89), the idea of Bateson’s cybernetic metaphor has not, as many believe, been to use the analogy of computer science to explain human behaviour within the family system. Bateson’s primary example of a cybernetic explanation of restraints constituted by the collision of meaning is the double bind: the “damned if you do, and damned if you don’t”—caught between two wrongs and/or two rights (Strate, 2013, p. 204).

Different from the ‘positive explanation’ common in the social sciences, which looks at cause-and-effect relations between already individuated agents and domains, the ‘negative’ or ‘cybernetic’ explanation (BATESON, 1972) takes a step back to look at recursive relations of co-production Some of Bateson’s ideas have appeared earlier in this blog, and in my book , under the titles “ Why a Swan? "Cybernetics is the science of effective organization, of control and communication in animals and machines. Gregory Bateson was one of the most important and least understood thinkers of the twentieth century. Bateson originated the double bind theory of schizophrenia, was the first to apply cybernetic theory to the social sciences, and made important biological discoveries about such nonhuman species as the dolphin. The American Behavioral Scientist 10(8): 29–32. Bateson and his colleagues, the Palo Alto Group, were interested in developing a communication theory, which applies basic cybernetic principles within the family system, to explain the etiology of schizophrenia.  The statement was a revelation.

Because it depends on interrelationships, by its very nature information cannot be neutral with respect to how it is processed and perceived. In his book Steps to an Ecology of Mind, Bateson applied cybernetics to the field of ecological anthropology and the concept of homeostasis. He saw the world as a series of systems containing those of individuals, societies and ecosystems. Within each system is found competition and dependency. The system is seen as closed with in-tact boundaries where only negative feedback may be defined. Gregory Bateson (9 May 1904 – 4 July 1980) was an English anthropologist, social scientist, linguist, visual anthropologist, semiotician and cyberneticist whose work intersected that of many other fields. Bateson also attended Charterhouse School (in the town where I now liveiii). Part V: Epistemology and Ecology.
