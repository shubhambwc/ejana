A matrix of dissociation conditions was tested to identify optimal protocols for multiple solid tumor types and tonsil controls (Fig. BD TTDR is optimized to maximize cell yields, while minimizing cell death and epitope/antigen damage. The approximate timing of the protocol is: 10–30 minutes for mechanical dissociation, 1 hour for enzymatic dissociation, 15–30 minutes for cell straining, 10–30 minutes for red blood cell lysis and counting, and 10–30 minutes for diluting cells for cryopreservation, if needed (see Basic Protocol 1). Unfortunately, intertumoral heterogeneity represents the most significant, and most difficult to control, variable in these procedures. In the conventional method, the kidney capsule is removed and tissue minced in dissociation solution (see methods) and then incubated at 37°C for 45 min. They felt been grown in vitro for closure as lazy as people tivation of animal RPE. 4.1.2.Cell Separation Buffer ‘PB Buffer’: Prepare with PBS (Phosphate Buffered Saline) and 0.5% BSA Cell dissociation remains a major obstacle to the technical evolution of solid tumor flow cytometry. To uncover transcriptional variation and responses to dissociation method, we generated scRNA-seq data for 155,165 single cells across a range of substrates, cancer types, dissociation temperatures, and tissue states (Fig. The conventional (late fixation) and modified (early fixation) protocols for kidney tissue dissociation into a single cell suspension for flow cytometry.
