Two equal and opposite forces exert a purely rotation force. Supraspinatus. • For some shoulder girdle movements, scapula must rotate or tilt on its axis • Lateral tilt (outward tilt) – during abduction – scapula rotates about its vertical axis resulting in posterior movement of medial border & anterior movement of lateral border • Medial tilt (return from lateral tilt, inward tilt) – during extreme adduction Place one hand on her upper arm just above the elbow and press the upper arm into the body for stability.
