Fold the inner bag over the outbag to seal them and keep the blubber inside. Supplies. In this video, we learn how to do an animal blubber (fat) glove experiment. Blubber is a thick layer of fat beneath the skin of marine animals. You can duct tape the seams together to make sure the blubber stays in the glove. Insulation slows the transfer of heat, keeping the whale warm in very low temperatures. Will a layer of fake blubber—in the form of shortening—help you keep from getting cold? Placing the shortening within two ziplock bags creates a barrier between it and children&#x27;s hands, while also mimicking the effects of the blubber layer.
