International Journal of River Basin Management is a quarterly academic journal issued for the first time during the Third World Water Forum in Kyoto, March 2003.It is published in print and electronic format by Taylor &amp; Francis, on behalf of the International Association of Hydraulic Engineering and Research, the International Association of Hydrological Sciences and the International Network . Intermittent rivers are defined as rivers with a high seasonality in water, sediment transport and habitat. 1The Register of International River Basins of the World defines a &#x27;river basin&#x27; as the area which contributes hydrologically (including both surface- and groundwater) to a first order stream, which, in turn, is defined by its outlet to the ocean or to a terminal (closed) lake or inland sea.
