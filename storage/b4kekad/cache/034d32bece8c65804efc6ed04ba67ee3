Metagenomics, together with in vitro evolution and high-throughput screening technologies, provides industry with an unprecedented chance to bring biomolecules into industrial application. The vast un-tapped potential applications of NGS along with its rapidly declining costs, give this technology the ability to contribute significantly to consumer protection, global (2019). Metagenomics is the study of microbial communities sampled directly from their natural environment, without prior culturing. However, its main purpose is to infer the taxonomic profile of a microbial community. metagenomics and examine its recent application to microbial ecology and bi otechnology. Sample collection, preparation, and storage should be handled carefully to prevent lysis and decomposition of the sample compositions. Features a range of chapters that present an introduction to the field and functional insight into various ecosystems. 3.2.3.1 Sequence-based metagenomics: Sequence-based metagenomics provides information on the distribution of functions in a community, linkage of traits, genomic organization and horizontal gene transfer. Of these steps, the sampling process is very crucial for the downstream applications. The arid and semi-arid regions of Rajasthan are one of the most extreme biomes of India, possessing diverse microbial communities that exhibit immense biotechnological potential for industries. Metagenomics studies focus on microbial diversity, community constitute, genetic and evolutionary relationships, functional activities, and interactions an … As shown in Figure 1, the main difference between genomic and metagenomics analysis is that genomic analysis is done with a culture of a single microbe, while metagenomics analysis uses the community of many, mainly unculturable, microbial species. 1 and 2), to address still open challenges in the field but also to provide an A-to-Z approach that can support both novices and specialists. Genome assembly algorithms have been an important component of efforts to characterize the genomes of single organisms and have been key to the modern genomic revolution. Clinical metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS), the comprehensive analysis of microbial and host genetic material (DNA and RNA) in samples from patients, is rapidly moving from research to .
