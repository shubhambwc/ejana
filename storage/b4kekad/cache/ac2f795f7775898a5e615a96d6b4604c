Latest version is found on online docwiki.embarcadero.com/RADStudio/en/Delphi_Language_Guide_Index This class introduces read-only property called Memory which is of pointer type. If you make it inherit from TPersistent Delphi will handle the properties of the class property as if they were properties of the main component itself, just like Delphi handles Fonts belonging to Controls. If you read between the lines, you will find that class methods are accessible even when you haven't created an instance of the class (the object).

Every abstract class and every concrete class is a descendant of Root, so all classes have at least one constructor. Canvas is an area of form where we can draw shapes, lines and can fill colors on shapes. TMemoryStream is descendant of TStream class. There are four kinds of Open Tools APIs: property editors, component editors, experts/wizards and version control systems.This paper will focus on Property and Component Editors, giving several examples of how to write our own Delphi Property and Component Editors. It stores the supplied default ordinal property value in the run time information for the class. Ask Question Asked 9 years, 7 months ago.
