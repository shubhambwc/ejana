Posterior capsulorhexis performed with dry aspiration of opacities, avoid rupturing anterior hyaloid, and posterior optic button hole fixation of the intraocular lens. . A grading system for evaluating posterior polar cataract with AS-OCT was derived based on the morphology of posterior capsule and its relationship to the posterior polar cataract on the high-resolution AS-OCT images. This is a natural process that tends to happen as we age. She had poor vision. ICD10-Code: Q12.03. I thought posterior polar cataract is basically a posterior subcapsular cataract but have the cataract concentrated in the visual axis instead of surrounding it. Congenital posterior polar cataract is a localised central sub-capsular opacification of the crystalline lens.

Yet another form of autosomal dominant anterior polar cataract is associated with corneal disease (Cataracts, Anterior Polar with Guttata) ( 121390 ). With time, or injury, the lens can lose its flexibility, causing the light that passes through it to fracture and split.
