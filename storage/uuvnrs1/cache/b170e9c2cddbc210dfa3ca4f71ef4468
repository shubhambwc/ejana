Synthetic biology incites natural products industry into action. But in the last 6-7 decades biology has undergone a revolutionary transformation with an understanding of the molecular processes underlying how cells and organisms work. Synthetic biology enables scientists to design and synthesise new sequences of DNA from scratch. NASA is investigating two potential applications of synthetic biology—one to advance nutrition and one to increase in-space manufacturing capabilities. Synthetic biology is a combination of biology and different branches of engineering, such as electrical, mathematical, mechanical, and computer, providing a greater ability of understanding and manipulation of the biological systems or creation of novel life forms [1]. Synthetic biology products in the medical industry range from gene therapies and pharmaceutical drugs to vaccine development. Synthetic biology is the engineering of biology: the synthesis of complex, biologically based, or inspired, systems which display functions that do not exist in nature. Synthetic cells as… Among engineers, Benner said at the conference SB5.0 held at Stanford University in June, &quot;synthetic biology seeks to use natural parts of biological systems (like DNA fragments or protein biobricks) to create assemblies that do things that are not done by natural biology, such as digital computation or manufacture of Chances are you are reading this article because you&#x27;ve heard the phrase &#x27;synthetic biology&#x27; and want to know what it means. The synthetic systems created may be used to generate products ranging from ethanol and drugs to . Synthetic biology is an interdisciplinary branch of biology and engineering that has the potential to advance the nutrition and safety of astronauts living away from Earth for long periods of time. The final goal is to ultimately design living biological systems in a similar fashion to the way that engineers design electronic or mechanical systems. In plain English: We can harness the power of living cells to grow food and crops in a factory-like process (i.e., we can grow meat in a lab)! These include evolutionary biology, biotechnology, genetic engineering, molecular engineering system biology, biophysics, biological engineering, chemical engineering, electrical engineering, computational engineering, control engineering, and many other fields.
