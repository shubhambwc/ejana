Submarine Volcanoes and Hydrothermal Vents. The study of volcanoes is called volcanology. Here, ocean crust that was born along the mid-ocean ridges millions of years ago in the eastern Pacific is . These volcanoes occur in a range of forms. Right: Kavachi, a submarine volcano in the Solomon Islands, has built itself above sea level at least nine times since 1950. As the tectonic plates move away or towards each other, lava that is present below the surface of the earth, is thrown out with pressure through a fissure on the earth&#x27;s surface. Whats the difference between a seamount and Tablemount? Submarine landslides or lava flows from one of these volcanoes could also damage offshore oil platforms, eventually leading to regional environmental disasters. Underwater volcano facts inform us that almost all submarine volcanoes are located near the boundaries of two adjacent tectonic plates. Submarine volcanoes are pretty much ubiquitous in all of the world&#x27;s major oceans and it&#x27;s estimated that 75% of the Earth&#x27;s magma output comes from mid-ocean ridges.

From 1975 to 1985, 160 volcanoes erupted but only 24 of these were submarine. These are usually located by hydrothermal vents, or black smokers, which have been located at all of the mid-ocean ridges around the world. The two types of volcano form in different places and have very different characteristics. In geology, a hotspot is an area of the Earth&#x27;s mantle from which hot plumes rise upward, forming volcanoes on the overlying crust. Because they erupt into water instead of air, submarine volcanoes behave quite differently than terrestrial volcanoes. Superheated lava was photographed by a remotely-operated underwater robot at a depth of 4,000+ feet. Interestingly, 80% of the Earth&#x27;s volcanic activities can be found under the ocean and the total number of these under ocean volcanoes is approximately 1 million.
