High species turnover of the ant genus Solenopsis (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) along an altitudinal gradient in the Ecuadorian Andes, indicated by a combined DNA sequencing and morphological approach Limited dispersal or high environmental heterogeneity between sites results in faster decrease in community similarity along envi-ronmental and spatial distance and higher turnover rate, char- Phytophagous insects show similarly high turnover, but their patterns are closely coupled to those of their hosts. Solenopsis species were found up to an altitudinal record of 3000 m. Most morphospecies (20 of 24) were found at a single elevation. High species turnover shapes anuran community composition in ponds along an urban-rural gradient | bioRxiv bioRxiv posts many COVID19-related papers. 4 Carolina Cunha Ganci1*, Diogo B. Provete2,3, Thomas Püttker4, David Lindenmayer5, 5 Mauricio Almeida-Gomes2 6 7 1 Pós-Graduação em Ecologia e Conservação, Universidade Federal de Mato Grosso do Sul, Local mammalian communities exhibited a high degree of species turnover between landscapes, representing 95% of the total β-diversity. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31014234/">Clade-age-dependent diversification under high species ...</a> Another aspect of the study, reinforcing this hypothesis, is that high beta diversity within the fragments is mainly due to species turnover and not to richness nestedness, contrary to expectations generated by Laurance et al. 37 Full PDFs related to this paper. title = &quot;High spatial turnover in springtails of the Cape Floristic Region&quot;, abstract = &quot;Aim: The extraordinary diversity of plants across the Cape Floristic Region is characterized by considerable species turnover among sites. Dissimilarity among sites was driven by high species turnover with 59% of species exclusive to a single site, whereas nestedness among sites was low except at the lowest elevation site. Read Paper. studied changes in functional diversity of bird species groups by 2080 at the scale of whole of Europe based on bioclimatic envelope modeling. Large geographi-cal distances may generate high species turnover by lowering the probability of species exchange through dis-persal and increasing the probability of anagenetic M-I species turnover patterns were very similar for both anoles and terraranans (figure 3a,b). Dinosaurs have high species and genus turnover and rapid diversification, which Bakker interprets as evidence for a high metabolism. Dissimilarity among sites was driven by high species turnover with 59% of species exclusive to a single site, whereas nestedness among sites was low except at the lowest elevation site. In this paper, we propose families of . high species turnover across the Neotropics, (ii) the determi-nation of areas of endemism for the genus and their possible relationship with the areas of species turnover, (iii) the evalu-ation of climatic niche differences across areas of endemism, and(iv)the modeling ofthe potential distribution andQuercus The prevalence of species turnover over nestedness indicates that different forest sites have a fairly distinct subset of species (i.e., high complementarity in species composition). The high spe-cies turnover, relative to functional turnover, also indicates that a large number of bird . High levels of species turnover have previously been reported for studies on kwongan at the scale of single reserve (22.5 km 2, ) and at a regional scales (12,000 km 2) along the south coast, including kwongan, mallee and salt lake communities . Our ﬁndings suggest nant species alone can stabilize community biomass, meaning greaterstabilityin less evencommunities(17, 18).In this case,the presence of a species in the community with temporally stable high productivity might be sufﬁcient to guarantee function over time, in which case species turnover would not promote high functioning. Jon Moen and Anna Lagerström &quot;High Species Turnover and Decreasing Plant Species Richness on Mountain Summits in Sweden: Reindeer Grazing Overrides Climate Change,&quot; Arctic, Antarctic, and Alpine Research 40(2), 382-395, (1 May 2008). However, using pairwise metrics to measure species turnover does not allow species shared by more than two sites (common species) to be accounted for. Our findings suggest that features of the environment may influence both trophic structure and dynamic stability, leading to emergent omnivory‐stability relationships. Specific (acquired) immunity. The proportion of salinity-tolerant species varied the most in May: while the share of marine species exceeded 20% in few pools and the spatial dominance of brackish species was the highest . Other formulations for beta diversity include &quot;absolute species turnover&quot;, &quot;Whittaker&#x27;s species turnover&quot; and &quot;proportional species turnover&quot;. This argument rests on the claim that high metabolism is correlated with high evolutionary turnover. In the latter study geographic and edaphic factors were both found to be independently important in . High rates of turnover and elevation-dependent communities suggest that ground-dwelling arthropods are highly We revisited the summits (defined as the top 50 altitudinal meters of each mountain) in 2002, and recorded all species. High species richness will be negatively correlated (negative slope) with high species turnover (Lonsdale 1999; Shurin 2007; Bakker et al. Such high species turnover indicates that the salinity gradient acted as a strong filter on the diatom species at this marine-freshwater transition zone. Previous studies have found that species turnover is usually higher than intraspecific variation across terrestrial plant assemblages because it is a focal parameter of spe-cies coexistence due to differing degrees of trait and niche overlap Both models could produce the observed pattern of declining turnover at higher diversity under some circumstances, however the conditions for The results show that there is an ongoing considerable species turnover due to climate change and due to land use and other direct human influence. M-I species turnover patterns were very similar for both anoles and terraranans (figure 3 a,b). High species turnover shapes anuran community composition in ponds along an urban-rural 2. gradient 3. The fact that ecosystem functioning was more strongly related to variation in species richness than to species turnover is remarkable because species turnover along the elevational gradient was . In particular, increased temperature can increase dominant ant species which can destabilize insect communities ( Diamond et al. Stable trophic structure across coastal nekton assemblages despite high species turnover. One of the main factors responsible for species turnover is a heterogeneous environment (Wright et al. Download Download PDF. Eco-tones may feature unusually steep gradients of abiotic environ-mental change e either as a cause to biotic species turnover (e.g., Seasonal β-diversity decreased with elevation and the high turnover of species across seasons contributed to a considerably higher γ- than α-diversity on study plots. Species sorting mediated by environmental variation might explain the high species turnover of aquatic plants and cladocerans at regional scale, while biogeographic processes enhanced by dispersal limitation among regions might determine the composition of regional biotas. . March 2016. Pages 281-288. Fig. High levels of species turnover have previously been reported for studies on kwongan at the scale of single reserve (22.5 km 2, ) and at a regional scales (12,000 km 2) along the south coast, including kwongan, mallee and salt lake communities . High species turnover of the ant genus Solenopsis (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) along an altitudinal gradient in the Ecuadorian Andes, indicated by a combined DNA sequencing and morphological approach species are distributed along environmental gradients &quot;individualistically&quot; - that is, independently of other species. Volume 39, Issue 3. nities. Generalist, exotic and non-forest dwelling species accounted for 60% of all mammals persisting within the landscapes. New Results Declining turnover with increasing richness occurred when higher diversity either facilitated colonization by new species or reduced extinction rates of extant species. to beetles dominating high-elevations. Such extreme species An easily accessible index of the underlying evolution is the so-called species turnover distribution (STD), defined as the probability P (r,t) that the population of any species has varied by a fraction r after a given time t. WikiMatrix We . 1998). DOMINGO FLORES-HERNANDEZ. They observed that in northern Fennoscandia (including Finland), there was a decrease . In this region, where there was no regional extinction, landholder compliance with the Brazilian Forest Bill and restoration measures will enhance habitat connectivity and mammal persistence across the wider . 4 Carolina Cunha Ganci1*, Diogo B. Provete2,3, Thomas Püttker4, David Lindenmayer5, 5 Mauricio Almeida-Gomes2 6 7 1 Pós-Graduação em Ecologia e Conservação, Universidade Federal de Mato Grosso do Sul, The similarity in functional roles despite the high species turnover suggests that the ecological process of seed dispersal is organized similarly along the Andes, with similar functional roles fulfilled locally by different sets of species. Congruence between taxa for areas of high species richness can facilitate conservation planning (25).  D. Hernandez. However, measures that reflect the rate at which individuals of a species are replaced by individuals of another species are far more sensitive to change. found that temporal turnover among zooplankton species declines with long-term diversity among lakes in the temperate zone, but that diversity and turnover are both lower at high latitude.
