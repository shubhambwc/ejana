Genes are added, deleted or temporarily silenced to produce desired results. Some animals selectively bred for the meat (beef cattle) while others were bred for the milk (dairy cattle). this is fairly easy, as all you have to do is select the favourable characteristics in the parents, breed them and produce lots of offspring (much easier with plants), and then select the offspring. Many years of selective breeding to improve the quality of fur-coat and pelt size, in line with market expectations [11,12], have changed the morphology, behaviour and other features of the species, thereby differentiating feral and farm animals [13,14]. a. cloning c. polyploid planting b. hybridization d. selective breeding 16.

Selective breeding is one form of biotechnology important in agriculture and medicine because when scientists manipulate the genetic makeup of an organism they are using biotechnology. Animal genomics are very concerned with challenges in . d. selective breeding. Selective breeding is one example of biotechnology. Selective Breeding Type Description Examples Crossing dissimilar individuals to bring together the best of both organisms The continued breeding of individuals with similar characteristics Increasing Variation 7. Some methods, such as selective breeding, are extremely old and have been used since the beginning of agriculture. How does selective breeding differ from genetic modification? Selective breeding allows producers to select and breed parent organisms with . Modern Biotechnology. Firstly, individual plant selection. Cross-breeding, selective breeding, and mutation breeding are examples of traditional ways to make these changes. The process of breeding plants (or animals) for desirable traits or for the elimination of a trait. answer choices . . Since the 1700s, farmers and scientists have been cross-breeding plants within a species and mixing the genetic makeup of different plants . LECTURE 41 - PLANT IMPROVEMENTS: BIOTECHNOLOGY I. Selective Breeding. Selective breeding pioneers were manipulating the genetic makeup of organisms without even realising it. This selective breeding was used to obtain desired traits such as disease resistance, better taste and higher yield. The process of selective breeding of animals and plants to obtain offspring with certain specific characteristic or characteristics is referred to as selective . Artificial Selection. VocabularyGenetics, trait, drought, meiosis, genetic modification The purpose of this activity is to simulate selective breeding as it is accomplished by plant scientists. Length: 1 hour. In traditional biotechnology, both selective breeding and crossbreeding are controlled by people, not nature. Although we tend to t hink of biotechn ology as invol v ing high-powered equipment in glea ming labo ratori es, humans have been practicing biotechnology for tho usand s of year s as they bred do m . Intensive artificial selection has led to the production of the modern broiler chicken, which over the last few decades has undergone a dramatic increase in growth rate and noticeable changes in body conformation. 4, 1, 5, 3, 2 B. Diverse bacterial strains have been bred from mutated lines. B. Alana Lichacz. Traditional methods of modifying plants, like selective breeding and crossbreeding, have been around for nearly 10,000 years. 1. SURVEY . Dog breeds are another example of selective breeding. Which of these actions can produce a clone? In 2020, genetically engineered crops were grown on about 96% of planted acres in the United States. Selective Breeding. 1. b. offspring breeding. Q. Biotechnology commonly includes a set of methods that scientists and engineers use to modify the genetic composition of organisms. Report an issue . • Biotechnology has been practiced for the last 10,000 years. Moreover, selective breeding and crossbreeding often produce mixed results, with unwanted traits appearing alongside desired characteristics. Previous forms of biotechnology include the training and selective breeding of animals, the cultivation of crops and the utilization of micro-organisms to produce products such as cheese, yogurt, bread, beer and wine. •Biotechnology - using living organisms, or the products of living organisms, for human benefit to make a product or solve a problem •Historical Examples -Fermentation -Selective breeding -Use of antibiotics • genomes of species through various selective breeding practices for characters, ranging from color, growth, composition and disposition (Koopaei and Koshkoiyeh, 2011). They are used to create common crops like modern corn varieties5 and seedless watermelon. With the advancement in the techniques of biotechnology, hybridization, cloning, and recombinant DNA technology was developed.
