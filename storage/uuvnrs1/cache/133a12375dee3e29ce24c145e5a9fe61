Chocolate syrups. Commercial Applications The global demand of enzymes, for a wide variety of applications, is significant. considerable interest for application in the food flavor industry. In applications, enzymes are often immobilized on inert and insoluble carriers, which increase their efficiency due to multiple reusability. Enzymes have found widespread application in food industry due to their specificity, efficacy at milder reaction conditions, safety, acceptability, and ease of control. Enzymes in food production; A majority of drinks and foods in our daily lives are dependent on the food production industry. Lipases are expected to achieve the increase in sale by around 6.8% by 2024. Of the classes of enzymes used by the food industry, the proteases and carbohydrases account for most of this market. In this sector of food processing, the major use of the immobilized enzyme is in the production of high fructose corn syrup (HFCS). Applications Of Enzymes In Biotechnology. 41.3.9.

The present article Division of Food Science and reviews the applications of enzymes in food industry. • Processed foods provide convenience, improved shelf-life, increased palatability and offer variety in the diet. Candy. • Additionally its is used for extraction of colour and juice from fresh fruit • It breaks down pectin and releases methanol, which in high amounts is hazardous. The use of enzymes or microorganisms in food preparations is an age-old process. Lipases are amongst most versatile enzymes and have a broad variety of industrial applications due to the multiplicity of reaction they catalyze. Enzymes are intimately involved in a wide variety of traditional food processes, such as cheese-, beer- and wine-making. The role of enzymes in the food industry. Refer to the application of immobilized enzymes for details. Without . Enzymes either combine molecules to produce new products or break a molecule into smaller parts. A special application of laccase is the use of bottle corks in the production process to reduce the tart flavour that arises during long storage of wine [4], [5]. However, all these desirable characteristics of enzymes and their widespread industrial applications are often hampered by their lack of long-term operational stability and shelf-storage life and by their cumbersome recovery and reuse.
