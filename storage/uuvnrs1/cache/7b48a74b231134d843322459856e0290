VPDP provides brakes, reverse move as well as a perfect distribution of the power between thrusting and lifting system depending on operating conditions. A hovercraft is 100% more fuel-efficient than a boat with similar capacity or size. Extremely fuel efficient, leaves almost no wake in water, leaves no tracks on land, very low noise levels, and assembled in a facility powered by wind energy. Disadvantages • They move a lot of air and can be relatively loud (Noise Pollution). The Landing Craft Air Cushion is a fully amphibious landing craft capable of carrying a 60-ton payload at high . A hovercraft is the least efficient solution fuel-wise, because it constantly has to fight gravity to just keep in the air. It travels over water with no concern for depth or hidden obstacles. Renegade hovercraft are manufactured with the newest most high performance materials available today. Destined for Hovertravel&#x27;s Portsmouth to Isle of Wight route, the 12000TD will the replace two 30-year-old AP .
