Description: The Nike Dunk Low Marina Blue is the latest Dunk to demand a spot in your collection. One of the most iconic basketball sneakers created by Nike, the Dunk originally made its debut in 1985. The lighter of the two shades takes over the pair&#x27;s base, while the low-top Nike Dunk&#x27;s overlays around the forefoot, along the tongue and across the heel opt for the titular &quot;Dark Marina Blue&quot; color, effectively inverting the original &quot;Argon&quot;&#x27;s arrangement. The Dunk Low &quot;Dark Marina Blue,&quot; a reiteration of the OG &quot;Argon&quot; colorway released in the early 2000s, comes with a reversed theme. Authenticity Open tab.
