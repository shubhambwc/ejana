The Drosophila melanogaster genome includes 18 different genes that encode members of the nuclear receptor superfamily, a modest number compared to some invertebrate species such as Caenorhabditis (Table 248.1).A large number of Drosophila hormone receptors (DHRs) have been identified and named based on their deduced amino acid sequence (e.g., DHR38, DHR78, etc. Sex ratios of Fi hybrids between Zimbabwe and non-Zibabwe Drosophila melanogaster.
