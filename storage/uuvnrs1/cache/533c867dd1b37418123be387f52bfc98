Briefly, systems biology approaches rely on dynamic, high-content datasets and mathematical abstractions in the form of computational models. During the 1990s, the ability to manipulate actinomycete genes, developed over previous decades, mainly using the model species Streptomyces coelicolor ( Hopwood 1999 ), was combined with chemical and biochemical experiments to begin to crack this &#x27;polyketide code&#x27;.
