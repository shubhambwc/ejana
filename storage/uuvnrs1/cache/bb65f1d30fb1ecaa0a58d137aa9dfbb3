For applications with high or low temperatures, very long service life, high radiation loads and wherever very low permeation rates are important, metal seals must be used instead of the elastomer seals. HELICOFLEX®. Style 65 High Temperature Metal Bellows Rotary is able to seal high temperature (up to 800°F) primarily because it uses a graphite wedge as a secondary seal rather than an o-ring elastomer. Common applications include high temperature gaskets, oven door seals, metal casting seals, and expansion joint packing. Size: 25.00 mm to 100.00 mm. We co-develop with technology driven automotive partners and supply High Speed Lip Seals, Low Friction Lips Seals, Precision Injection Molded Components and Extreme High Temperature Metal Seals. High Temperature Seals . Features. Contact Kalsi Engineering to learn how the floating metal backup ring technology can be applied to your high-pressure sealing application. Chemical and pollution control equipment, ash pit seals, nuclear reactors, marine equipment, ducting, thrust reverser assemblies, fuel nozzles, afterburners, spray bars. High Temperature Rubber Metal Bonded Seal Washer Kit-DMS Seal Manufacturer. Static leakage tests with hot air at a high temperature (max. A resilient annular Belleville spring portion is . Style 65 is not repairable. Seals for operation at 1000 deg C or lower can be made using palladiumcobalt braze alloy. For available high pressure seal sizes, see our online shaft seal catalog. Self-adhering, high-temp metal roofing underlayment and vapor barrier. Single ply double ply bellow configrations. Available in edge welded or hydro formed bellow design. Micro Plasma welding prevents heat damage on the metal bellow foils during the weld process. The CTE of glass and metal in matched seals is balanced. High Temperature Gaskets &amp; Seals Custom Gasket Mfg. These seals must function at high temperatures between 600 and 900 °C and in the oxidizing and reducing environments of fuels and air. Temperature limit: -272 °C - 800 °C. These can be used in highly viscous liquids and corrosive media. Features. 3.2.2.2 Metal seals. For example, when: Temperature is too hot or too cold &amp; pressure is too high or there is a vacuum. High Pressure High Temperature Springless Rotary Shaft Oil Seal With Metal Case (HP) | #15409 5066 Parker&#x27;s HP Profile is a springless rotary shaft oil seal suited for high temperature and high pressure applications with its metal outer case, fluoroelastomer (FKM) sealing element, and PTFE back-up element. All metal parts are designed to handle elevated temperatures without adverse effects: heat treated AM350 or Alloy 718 bellows, low-expansion alloy . New High-Temperature, HighPressure Seals Needed -• Reliable high -temperature seals of metal pipes to ceramic heat exchangers are required • Enables advanced high-temperature power generation systems that utilize power cycles based on steam or supercritical CO. 2 (sCO. Typical applications for these seals include hydrocarbons, aromatic fractionation products, crude oil fractionation products and heat transfer fluids, as well as chemicals, caustics . TEL：+86-757-86235767. The Type 609HTC is a high-temperature bellows assembly intended for those demanding applications where a dependable, high-strength, rotating seal is preferred. The seal faces are the elements that define the sealing . A functioning solid oxide fuel-cell (SOFC) may require all types of seals, such as metal-metal, metal-ceramic, and ceramic-ceramic. Our metal seals are ideal for high-pressure, high-temperature, harsh chemicals and vacuum applications. The sealing concept of Metal O-Rings is based on the elastic deformation of the tube which, during the compression cycle, gives a contact point on each sealing surface. Diameter: 4 mm - 8,000 mm. APCO High Temperature Metal Bellow Seal, Size: 25.00 Mm To 100.00 Mm. AmeriSeal™ C-seals help overcome both heat and pressure pulsating sealing problems. High strength and toughness from cryogenic temperatures to 1800 degrees F (980 degrees C), good oxidation resistance, exceptional fatigue strength, and good corrosion resistance. We import the raw materials of the metal bellow from Germany for high quality. Finding the Right Seal. Metal O-Rings are manufactured from stainless steel or high temperature alloy tubing or wire. SB10HP. This is why we have become leaders in the industry. A metal seal is used when the application conditions are outside the specification limits of a polymer. The High Temperature Metal Bellow Seal (MBG) are used while working in high temperature applications. Quarterly Technical Report No. High Temperature Metal Bellows Seal Style: HTB The SEPCO HTB is a component metal bellows seal using grafoil secondary seals to handle elevated temperatures without any adverse effects. These seals resist steam, most refrigerants, salts, and grease. Abstract: Disclosed herein are valve seals wherein an annular metallic seal member is retained in an annular recess in a valve body wall, the seal member being resiliently deformable in both axial and radial directions. Metal Seals Parker is an industry leader in the design and manufacturer of metal seals and metal sealing systems for extreme applications. The Flexaseal Style 63/66 cartridge seal is specifically designed for ruggedness and durability to withstand higher temperature or dirty services.
