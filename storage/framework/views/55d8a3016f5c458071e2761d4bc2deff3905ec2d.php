                        <p class="text-muted" align="justify">Despite the coronavirus, the service can continue via Ejana. We keep a close eye on the official reports about the coronavirus. We follow the  guidelines of the RIVM and GGD and ask customers and candidates to take their responsibility to keep the children and each other healthy. This way, our candidates can remain available in a responsible way.  If the customer or candidate has corona-related complaints, of course no work will be done. Always discuss with each other before the appointment whether work can be done.

                  <p class="text-muted" align="justify">  Always ensure a minimum distance of 1.5 meters. For example, alternate the rooms where you are present: one person upstairs and the other downstairs, for example. There are also always chores that you can do outside as a candidate, think of window chasms, for example. The customer can also  take the opportunity and go for a break!</p>

                  <p class="text-muted" align="justify"> If the customer or helper has corona-related complaints(coughing, sneezing, sore throat, fever,  etc.), then no work is done. The same applies when one or more family members of the customer are sitting at home with complaints or when someone has a fever in the helper's household.</p>
                  <p class="text-muted" align="justify">Get tested as soon as possible for cold complaints and/ or fever.</p>

                  <p class="text-muted" align="justify">  Always discuss before the start of the appointment whether it is wise to go to work. Can't the candidate come because he/she has corona-related complaints and/ or someone from the family has a fever? Then the customer can book a replacement candidatevia the Ejana portal.</p>

                  <p class="text-muted" align="justify">  As soon as it is not possible to work due to corona-related complaints, the candidate will miss out on revenue. As a customer, you can consider not cancelling the appointments via the portal. These are then simply invoiced, so that the candidate still gets paid. That's how you help the candidate!</p>
