 As a helper: Check the  reviews that are included with the ad, so you get a good picture of the person. If there are no  reviews yet ask for references check to Ejana. As helper: ask all your employers to write a review!  This greatly destroyed your reliability!
As a helper, it is also not at all crazy to contact other helpers who are already working there,orhelpers who have worked there before. It always makes sense to hear how certain things go and what to take into account.

Use the agreementform
Make clear agreements with each other about the rates for which actions. Also discuss here when something work, and therefore paid, and when it is an introduction, or onboarding day  and possibly not paid.  
Always consult and sign an agreement before you start working. This will come up when you have made a booking.
Clearly include in the agreement what happens if the caregiver becomes ill, but also if the applicant is admitted, for example.
Also discuss what the notice period is from both sides, and stick to it. So you break up in good agreement, or something else happens and you prefer to get rid of each other immediately; If you make good agreements about the notice period, that is at least clear.

These kinds of rules are never that fun to discuss and you probably don't need everything. But if you have to, you're glad you're on paper. In addition, both the applicant and theapplicantapply, you are in a professional relationship with each other and professional agreements are part of that.
