First the plant parts material was rinsed in tap water to remove the dust and debris then cut into the small pieces by a sterilized blade under aseptic conditions. The fungi were subjected to solid-state fermentation on rice medium and the metabolites were extracted using ethyl acetate. The objective of this work was the isolation and identification of endophytic fungi from leaves of two peppermint species, Mentha piperita and Mentha canadensis. Many plant pathogenic fungi differentiate a series of highly specialized infection structures to invade and colonize host tissues. The fungal crude extracts were screened for antimicrobial activity. 2.2. Six different f ungal isolates were obtained from root, leaf and ste m plant parts. In the present study, a fungus isolated from leaf lesions was grown under different growth conditions in order to study its mycelial growth and spore production, determining that the solid medium. Leaf segments examined in the present study. Isolation, purification and maintenance of the endophytic fungus producing vinblastine and vincristine. C.

Fungi were isolated from small pieces of leaf, corm, pseudostem and fruit from diseased samples then the tissue surface was sterilized with 5% hypochlorite sodium and cultured on a potato dextrose agar (PDA) medium containing lactic acid. Five different taxa were represented by 11 isolates, and six isolates were grouped . This habitat is a unique enviro nment and a prote cted area. Efficient RNA isolation is a prerequisite for gene expression studies and it has an increasingly important role in the study of plant-fungal pathogen interactions. Endophytic Fungi of Teak leaves Tectona grandis L. and rain tree leaves Samanea saman Merr. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report describing the isolation of endophytic fungi residing in the leaf cells of the selected plant samples. World J Microbiol Biotechnol. From a tree in the Experimental Nursery of Kagoshima University, located at the city of Kagoshima, Phyllosticta sp. Isolation of Endophytic fungi: The endophytic fungi were isolated by the following method observed by Vinu and Jayashankar 2017. Isolation of Endophytic fungi: The endophytic fungi were isolated by the following method observed by Vinu and Jayashankar 2017. Res. The healthy plants without disease symptoms or pest infestation were selected. 2006; 22:481-486 21. was done according to the method described by [17, 30]. Endophytic fungi are found in all kinds of plants, i.e. Isolation of fungi Biol. K. Rajagopal and T. S. Suryanarayanan* Postgraduate and Research Department of Botany, Ramakrishna Mission Vivekananda College, Chennai 600 004, India Occurrence of asymptomatic fungal endophytes in green and senescent leaves of neem is reported. and Colletotrichum spp. To isolate fungi from leaves samples, the plant leaves were washed thoroughly in running tap water. Phongpaichit S . These are fungal microorganisms which asymptomatically inhabit plant tissues and have been isolated from many species of woody plants and grasses [6,5]. Isolation of endophytic fungi Healthy and mature Madhuca longifolia bark collected from local farms were used as source material for the isolation of fungi. We can isolate fungi by presenting a particular substance to the environment for colonization then later recovering it for isolation of the fungi that occupied it. We describe here a method to isolate the biotrophic hyphae of Colletotrichum higginsianum from Arabidopsis leaves, based on a combination of pre-enrichment by isopycnic centrifugation followed by further purification by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. The leaf samples were aseptically cut into small pieces of approximately 5 (Mwamburi× 5 mm while the root and branch samples were cut into 1 cm cross-section and further split longitudinally to expose the interior section under a biological safety cabinet to prevent contamination (Liu et al., 2007). Fresh and healthy leaves were collected in separate polythene bags, labelled, transported to the laboratory and stored at 10°C. 1. The samples were washed initially with running tap water for 10 min, then with 1% sodium hypochlorite for 3 - 4 min, followed by 70% ethanol wash for 1 min and then finally rinsed in sterile distilled water three times. isolation and identification of endophytic fungi with antimicrobial activities from the leaves of elaeocarpus sphaericus (gaertn.) Different types of baits might be pieces of wood, insects, carrot chunks, plastics, hair etc. Isolation of Endophytic Fungi: The leaf samples were surface sterilized by the modiﬁed method 9. The endophytic fungi were isolated following standard method and the pure culture of the isolates identified morphologically and molecularly.
