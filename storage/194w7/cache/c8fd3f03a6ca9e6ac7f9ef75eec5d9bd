In addition to industrial processes often concentrated in the cities, vehicle emission and stationary-source fuel combustion are the primary sources of air pollution. The paper, &quot; Air quality modeling to inform pollution mitigation strategies in a Latin American megacity, &quot; is published in Science of The Total Environment. In Latin America, the population of cities with high priority air pollution problems include approximately 81 million people or 26.5 percent of the total urban population of Latin America, correspond- ing to 30 million children (&lt; 15 years), 47 million adults (15-59 years) and 4 million elderly people (^&gt;60 years) who are exposed to air pollutant The previous guidelines were exceeded in 90% of Latin America, and the new guidelines are exceeded in virtually every city in the region.
