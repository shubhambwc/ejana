A DER file is an X.509 digital certificate encoded in binary - 1&#x27;s and 0&#x27;s. Base64 is a binary-to-text encoding scheme, so a PEM file, which is a Base64 encoded DER file, is that same X.509 certificate, but encoded in text, which (remember!)

X.509 is a standard format for public key certificates, digital documents that securely associate cryptographic key pairs with identities such as websites, individuals, or organizations. Sometimes we copy and paste the X.509 certificates from documents and files, and the format is lost. The trust anchor, nominally, has no issuer, but in many cases trust anchors are stored in the format of a certificate, usually self-issued (its subjectDN and issuerDN are identical) and self-signed (the signature on the certificate matches the public key in the certificate itself). To convert the file into the PKS#12 format, enter the . It exists other encoding formats for ASN.1 but DER is the one chosen for security since there is only one possible encoding given a ASN.1.
