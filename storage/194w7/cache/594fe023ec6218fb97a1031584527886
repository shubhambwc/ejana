TÜV SÜD, a world-leading certification body for safety in the autonomous vehicle industry, conducted an audit of Argo AI to verify Argo procedures pertaining to test driver selection, training, and oversight procedures conform to the Autonomous Vehicle Safety Consortium&#x27;s (AVSC) best practices and SAE International&#x27;s J3018 standard for safe on-road testing. The ruling begins to provide. As the technology for autonomous vehicles continues to develop, it may be necessary for state and municipal governments to address the potential impacts of these vehicles on the road. Autonomous Vehicles Finally Get Federal Safety Standards March 15, 2022 • by Fleet Forward Staff • Terms such as &quot;steering wheel&quot; and &quot;driver&#x27;s seat,&quot; won&#x27;t make sense to use as spatial references for autonomous vehicles that aren&#x27;t built with them. A-UGVs are already making warehouses safer and more efficient. Karina Ricks, the city of Pittsburgh&#x27;s Director of the new Department of Mobility and Infrastructure explains why one of her priorities is to get the public engaged in the development of public policy for autonomous vehicles at SAE&#x27;s first Innovations in Mobility Meetup - Pittsburgh. Autonomous Vehicles Standards Need Greater Focus on Vehicle-To-Vehicle (V2V) Communications A research team from The Ohio State Center for Automotive Research (CAR) is constructing a dedicated platform for cyber security testing in an autonomous vehicle (AV). Standards and Performance Metrics for On-Road Autonomous Vehicles. Autonomous Vehicle Engineering (AVE) covers the fast-evolving field of automated and connected vehicles from end to end. December 12, 2018 USDOT Announces 2018 Build Grant Recipients. The forthcoming IEEE P2846 standard provides a valuable framework for familiar driving scenarios, such as car-following, driving adjacent to other road users, intersections, occlusion scenarios. Australia has commenced a wide range of connected (using both cellular V2X and DSRC) and automated vehicle trials. 0. We find that, although FMVSS pose an obstacle to the deployment of many AV designs, the proposed solution — an adaption of the existing . of standards and industry best practices of producing auto-specific software.
